LETTER OF EXPLANATION
Re: Last Will and Testament of Michael James Porter
Date: June 19, 2025

To Whom It May Concern,

I, Michael James Porter, have prepared the attached Last Will and Testament to ensure that my wishes regarding the distribution of my estate and the care of my loved ones are clearly stated and legally executed upon my passing.

This Letter of Explanation is provided to offer further clarity on my intentions as expressed in the Will:

Primary Beneficiary
My beloved wife, Elizabeth Anne Porter, is named as the primary beneficiary of my estate. Should she survive me, it is my sincere wish that she receive all of my assets, both real and personal, absolutely and without restriction. She has been my life partner, and I trust her judgment in handling our affairs.

Contingent Beneficiaries
In the event that Elizabeth does not survive me, I have designated our children — Christopher James Porter, Emily Grace Porter, and Daniel Robert Porter — to receive my estate in equal shares. I have full confidence in their character and sense of responsibility, and I want each of them to benefit equally from my legacy.

Executor Appointment
I have appointed my wife as Executor of my Will, as she is the most familiar with our personal and financial matters. If she is unable or unwilling to serve, I have named our son, Christopher James Porter, to act as Executor. I believe he has the capability and integrity to manage my estate responsibly.

Simplification of Administration
To reduce the administrative burden, I have explicitly relieved my Executor from the requirement to post bond, file inventories or appraisals, or report to the courts. This provision is intended to ease the execution process and avoid unnecessary delays or complications.

Authority to Sell Property
I have granted my Executor broad authority to sell any of my property, whether real or personal, as they see fit. This flexibility is important to ensure the estate can be settled efficiently and in the best interests of the beneficiaries.

I hope this letter helps explain the reasoning behind my decisions and provides assurance that they were made thoughtfully, with the best intentions for my family. Should any questions arise, I trust that my Executor and family members will work together with compassion and respect.

With love and clarity,

Michael James Porter
